## Introduction

Fractional derivatives and integrals are essential mathematical operations used in various fields such as signal processing, physics, and engineering. This repository offers Python functions for calculating fractional derivatives and integrals efficiently using vectorization.

The original MATLAB implementations that served as the basis for this Python version are:
- Auralius Manurung's MATLAB repository: [Fractional Derivative and Integral](https://github.com/auralius/fractional-derivative-integral)
- Jonathan's MATLAB Central File Exchange: [Fractional Derivative](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45982-fractional-derivative)

## Usage

To get started with using the Python implementation, you can refer to the provided documentation and examples in the source code. The primary function for calculating fractional derivatives is `fgl_deriv`. You can find information on its usage by typing the following command in your Python environment:

```python
from fractional_derivative import fgl_deriv
help(fgl_deriv)
